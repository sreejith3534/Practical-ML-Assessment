# Introduction
Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it.

In this project, we will use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants to predict the manner in which they did the exercise.

## Downloading the Data
```{r}
library(caret)
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
library(randomForest)
library(corrplot)
trainUrl <-"https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv"
testUrl <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv"
trainFile <- "./data/pml-training.csv"
testFile  <- "./data/pml-testing.csv"
if (!file.exists("./data")) {
  dir.create("./data")
}
if (!file.exists(trainFile)) {
  download.file(trainUrl, destfile=trainFile)
}
if (!file.exists(testFile)) {
  download.file(testUrl, destfile=testFile)
}
```
After Downloading split into train and test set
```{r}
trainRaw <- read.csv("./data/pml-training.csv")
testRaw <- read.csv("./data/pml-testing.csv")
dim(trainRaw)
dim(testRaw)
```
The "classe" variable in the training set is the outcome to predict.
# Clean the data
In this step, we will clean the data and get rid of observations with missing values as well as some meaningless variables.

```{r}
sum(complete.cases(trainRaw))
trainRaw <- trainRaw[, colSums(is.na(trainRaw)) == 0] 
testRaw <- testRaw[, colSums(is.na(testRaw)) == 0] 
#Next, we get rid of some columns that do not contribute much to the accelerometer measurements.

classe <- trainRaw$classe
trainRemove <- grepl("^X|timestamp|window", names(trainRaw))
trainRaw <- trainRaw[, !trainRemove]
trainCleaned <- trainRaw[, sapply(trainRaw, is.numeric)]
trainCleaned$classe <- classe
testRemove <- grepl("^X|timestamp|window", names(testRaw))
testRaw <- testRaw[, !testRemove]
testCleaned <- testRaw[, sapply(testRaw, is.numeric)]
```

# Slice the data
```{r}
set.seed(22519) # For reproducibile purpose
inTrain <- createDataPartition(trainCleaned$classe, p=0.70, list=F)
trainData <- trainCleaned[inTrain, ]
testData <- trainCleaned[-inTrain, ]

```
# Data Modeling
We fit a predictive model for activity recognition using Random Forest algorithm because it automatically selects important variables and is robust to correlated covariates & outliers in general. We will use 5-fold cross validation when applying the algorithm.
```{r}
controlRf <- trainControl(method="cv", 5)
modelRf <- train(classe ~ ., data=trainData, method="rf", trControl=controlRf, ntree=250)
modelRf
predictRf <- predict(modelRf, testData)
confusionMatrix(testData$classe, predictRf)
accuracy <- postResample(predictRf, testData$classe)
accuracy
oose <- 1 - as.numeric(confusionMatrix(testData$classe, predictRf)$overall[1])
oose
# Predicting for Test Data Set
result <- predict(modelRf, testCleaned[, -length(names(testCleaned))])
result
```
